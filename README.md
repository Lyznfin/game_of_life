You can generate the initial state randomly by inputing 
the height and the width of the desired canvas or
you can pre-load an already built state

In addition to that, the Game module have 4 modes of state changing

2. [Von Neumann neighbourhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_universal_constructor)
3. [Brian's brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian%27s_Brain)
4. [Zombie (which I made up)]
